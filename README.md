# MikuMikuLoader
## A purely network-based modding platform for Project Sekai

`This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by Sega, Colorful Palette, Craft Egg, Crypton Future Media, or Project Sekai. It does not modify the game client, and does not distribute or contain any proprietary game assets. All reverse engineering was performed for interoperability and educational purposes under fair use principles.`

This project requires you to have Python 3 installed when building in order to interface with the UnityPy library, which is used during the final export of a mod. Binaries come with a version of Python.

This project is not currently usable. It should be in an extremely beta state within less than a month, at which point simple story injection should be functional.
