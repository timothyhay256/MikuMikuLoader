# MikuMikuLoader
## A network-based modding platform for Project Sekai

`This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by Sega, Colorful Palette, Craft Egg, Crypton Future Media, or Project Sekai. It does not modify the game client, and does not distribute or contain any proprietary game assets. All reverse engineering was performed for interoperability and educational purposes under fair use principles.`

In order to properly build this program with full functionality, you will need to obtain and provide the following files:
```assets
├── lookup
│   └── character2ds.json
└── story
    └── scenario
        └── template.yaml
```
The method of doing this is not provided here. If you want help to legally obtain these files, please reach out to `mikumikuloader [at] stay-silly.org`

#### This is currently unfinished, and not usable!
